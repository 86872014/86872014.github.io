  <div class="entry-content"><p>那年春天，家乡的葡萄藤发芽的格外早，还在乍暖还寒的季节里就偷偷的开出了小小花。蜜蜂就像闻到了味儿一样，嘤嘤的赶来了，在嫩绿的葡萄藤上下飞腾。</p>

<p>在这样忙碌的节奏里来到了初夏，葡萄藤结出了许多许多的葡萄宝宝。开始的时候呀，葡萄宝宝绿绿的、小小的还硬邦邦的，像个小绿豆，特不起眼——和那些又胖又紫、讨人喜欢的葡萄果差得远呢。</p>

<p>那些日子里葡萄藤除了孕育葡萄，还长出了很多新的绿绿的叶子。春天里忙碌的小蜜蜂很不开心，生气葡萄宝宝的到来破坏了它可以采蜜的葡萄花，时不时的飞过来露出它屁股上尖尖的针吓哭了葡萄宝宝。那些新长出的叶子赶忙把葡萄宝宝遮起来：</p>

<blockquote><p>“走开！走开！不要吓唬我的葡萄宝宝！”</p>

<p>“哼，小不起眼！” 蜜蜂嘟囔道 “就是你让我没有蜜采了！”</p>

<p>“贪心鬼蜜蜂快走开！”葡萄叶子喊道 “葡萄宝宝很可爱，你不要在这里捣乱！”</p></blockquote>

<p>在叶子的呵斥下，蜜蜂嘤嘤的飞走了，葡萄宝宝试探着、小心翼翼地从葡萄叶子的保护下探出头来，她的鼻尖碰到透过白云的阳光，暖暖的。</p>

<p>随着盛夏的到来，雷雨天也渐渐的多了起来。每逢雷雨天，轰隆隆的雷声总吓得葡萄宝宝呜呜大哭。</p>

<blockquote><p>“呜呜~不要打雷了，好害怕”</p>

<p>“呜呜~我不要下雨，我不要乌云” 葡萄宝宝呢喃着。</p>

<p>“傻孩子，打雷下雨是自然现象。我们不能阻拦，也不必害怕” 葡萄叶子安慰道 “快快躲到我的叶子下面来，就不会淋到了。”</p></blockquote>

<p>葡萄宝宝赶快躲进了叶子的臂弯里，葡萄叶子紧紧抱着宝宝，摇啊摇啊，嘴里哼着摇篮曲。葡萄宝宝在温柔的歌声中慢慢平静下来，悠悠的睡去。</p>

<p>夜里的风总是有那么一点凉，葡萄宝宝常常在夜里惊醒，看着这个没有阳光的世界总有些害怕。</p>

<p>“哇~哇哇~” 葡萄宝宝哭了，她闭着眼睛不停地踢腾这小腿。叶子赶紧搂紧葡萄宝宝，摇啊摇啊，唱着悠悠的歌谣。</p>

<p>“哇~哇哇~” 葡萄宝宝哭了，她睁开了小眼睛，看着夜空里闪闪的繁星。叶子赶紧搂紧葡萄宝宝，摇啊摇啊，唱着悠悠的歌谣。</p>

<p>“哇~哇哇~” 葡萄宝宝哭了，她揉着满是泪滴的眼睛，刚刚做了恶梦，她还迷迷糊糊的分不清是梦是醒。叶子赶紧搂紧葡萄宝宝，摇啊摇啊，唱着悠悠的歌谣。</p>

<p>“哇~哇哇~” 葡萄宝宝哭了，她的肚肚咕噜咕噜的叫了，她想喝一口甘甜的露水。叶子赶紧搂紧葡萄宝宝，摇啊摇啊，唱着悠悠的歌谣。</p>

<p>“哇~哇哇~” 葡萄宝宝哭了，她睁开眼发现太阳露出了头，可是她还想赖一会儿床。叶子赶紧搂紧葡萄宝宝，摇啊摇啊，唱着悠悠的歌谣。</p>

<p>就这样短暂又漫长的夜晚过去了，日复一日的重复着葡萄宝宝越长越大，她不再那么青涩，她的小脸红扑扑的，开始有了可爱的葡萄果的模样。</p>

<p>季节在从盛夏向着金秋过度，风也渐渐的更凉更频繁了，在每个夜晚都会听到葡萄藤不停地发出“沙沙”的响声，那声音有时像大海的波涛，一浪接一浪的绵延不断；有时又像山涧流淌的小溪，断断续续地时强时弱——那时每一片葡萄叶子呵护着她们怀中的宝宝，她们时而轻轻摇动，时而缓缓的歌唱。</p>

<p>摇啊，摇啊；唱啊，唱啊；把夏天摇成了秋天，把绿色唱成了金黄；那些嫩绿的葡萄叶子如今已经变得皱皱巴巴，曾经平滑的皮肤布满了皱纹，在寒冷的秋风里摇摇欲坠；而葡萄宝宝一个个的都长成了漂亮的葡萄果，大大的、紫紫的，一大串一大串挂满了枝头。</p>

<p>走过葡萄藤的人儿总要竖起拇指夸赞那些葡萄：</p>

<blockquote><p>  “今年的葡萄格外漂亮啊，又大又紫！”</p>

<p>  “今年的葡萄格外丰满啊，又多又饱满！”</p></blockquote>

<p>挂在藤上的葡萄们喜滋滋的听着人们的夸奖，黝黑的皮肤上泛着饱满的阳光，只有在夜里那“沙沙”的声音还在不停地作响……</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>在小镇一座有些年龄的工厂的矮墙下，总是发生着各种有趣的故事。温暖的阳光融化了积雪，阿牛和阿虎从枯黄侧草丛中萌芽，两个人都只冒出那么小小的嫩嫩绿绿的一小截儿。</p>

<blockquote><p>  “Hi，你是谁呀？”</p>

<p>“嗯，我叫阿牛。你呢？”</p>

<p>“啊，我叫阿虎”。</p></blockquote>

<p>他们两个便如此相识了，成了一对亲密的小伙伴，在春季暖暖的太阳下懒懒的打盹和闲聊。渐渐地他们发现彼此都有这一个共同的理想，那就是长得高高，要高过身边这堵墙。</p>

<p>伙伴的力量是无穷的，从那时起两个小家伙都在不停地努力生长，转眼炎热的夏天也不期而至了。热烈的阳光提供了更为充足的养分，阿牛和阿虎进入了快速生长期。不过两个小伙伴向上攀爬的方式很不同，阿牛既灵活又聪明总能找到合适的落脚点，阿虎相比之下就显得笨拙一些，由于要把自己胖嘟嘟的脚丫吸附在平整的墙面上，它就像一个不断犯错的孩子，总是要重复多次才能把握住一个位置。</p>

<p>过了一段时间，两个人的差距已经很大了，阿牛长得又细又长，身材没有一丝浪费已经判得很高很高了；阿虎相比之下就差了很多，它长得又粗又短，身上的皮肤也是褶皱斑驳不像阿牛那样光滑。然而不可否认的是，两个小伙伴都在信心满满的生长着，而且阿牛还开出了姹紫嫣红的喇叭花，那风姿很是美丽。</p>

<p>又过了一段时间，秋天来了，萧瑟的西风吹黄了大地，天气变得寒冷。阿牛和阿虎在风中冻得瑟瑟发抖。</p>

<blockquote><p>“好冷啊，”阿牛说：“我快要支持不住了。”</p>

<p>“嗯，再坚持一下，听过了今年的冬天就又能迎来春天的温暖了。”阿虎回答道。</p>

<p>“你看我细细的根茎，今年恐怕是不行了。不过我已经把梦想结成种子，明年春天我一定要努力生长。”</p></blockquote>

<p>说着说着，冬天来了。阿牛把梦想结成许愿的种子埋进深深的土壤里，她的藤蔓已经枯黄了。阿虎凭着胖嘟嘟的身材和有力的脚勉强顶住了寒风，在冬季的冰雪里沉默不语，静静等待春天的到来。</p>

<p>温暖的阳光再次融化了墙根的积雪，阿虎僵硬的身体也从温暖中渐渐恢复过来，它再次仰起头看看向上的路，发现身旁多了一株嫩绿的藤蔓。</p>

<blockquote><p>“你是谁？”</p>

<p>“我是阿虎，你呢？”</p>

<p>“我是阿牛，我要向上爬。”</p></blockquote>

<p>它们进行着和去年一样的对话，然后又开始了不断向上的路。这期间阿虎依然默默犯错默默修正，缓缓的向上爬取。阿牛，在阳光雨露的滋养下，再次显露出自己轻盈和聪慧的步伐，很快又一次超过了阿虎。</p>

<p>虽然又是一年，阿牛和阿虎似乎没有什么不同，阿牛仍然又长又细，阿虎依旧又粗又短，他们仍然在自己的抉择和判断中不断前行。可是，很快秋风起了，紧接着萧瑟的秋天和寒冷的冬季又会按时降临。阿牛依然选择了把梦结成种子，留给明年重新开始，阿虎还是选择了在寒冷中默默坚持。</p>

<p>就这样时间匆匆过去，年复一年阿牛总是不断许愿、不断开始，而且每一次都进行的很快；阿虎依然默默坚持，抓住每一年有限的时间努力向上爬，把自己粗糙的茎贴在墙上，让胖胖的脚有力的抓住墙面。</p>

<p>记不得过了多少年，也许是十个年头吧。这一年的春天阿牛再次从荒草中探出头来，开始新一年的梦想；它看见身旁一株高高地植物羡慕不已——他是多么高大啊，最高的地方都已经超过墙头了。</p>

<blockquote><p>“你好，请问你是谁呀？”</p>

<p>“我是阿虎，你呢？”</p>

<p>“我是阿牛，从今天起我要努力生长，争取一年就超过你！”</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>因为时间过得飞快，所以很多故事都要从很久很久以前讲起，以至于很多细节我们都记不清楚了。幸亏赛伦斯的故事并不久远，也就十几年的的时间吧，那时的情景还依稀在目——当然这并不重要，就算我记不清楚了，赛伦斯也会帮忙记住的。</p>

<p>那年开学，牧明老师的班级里来了很多新同学，其中有一个小姑娘叫做赛伦斯。由于是刚刚升入初中的一班同学，正是豆蔻年华的好时光，他们像一只只叽叽喳喳的小鸟无时无刻不在欢唱和嬉笑。</p>

<p>那真是一段奇妙的时光，女孩子就像刚刚破茧的年轻蝴蝶一样每天都在变得越来越美丽，男孩子？那就更不要说了，他们虽然还没破茧但是却个个都像……额，想什么呢？这个词可能并不怎么好，不过，就像生蚝吧——怎么说呢？就是个个都并不华丽闪亮，但是无论是造型、行动还是品位上都足够突出、足够奇葩！</p>

<p>初中生活，真是一个热闹的大家庭。赛伦斯，嗯~也是一枚破茧的蝴蝶，不过她并不惹眼，在这个集体里总是那么安静的美好。可以说她并不突出甚至除了安静一点特点都没有，若干年后老同学聊起时恐怕很难想到这个姑娘，不过要是谁突然提起她来的时候，大家先是一愣然后一定会恍然大悟一样“哦，原来是她呀！”——他们总是这么说。</p>

<p>那时的女孩子大致上分两类，一类是只和女孩玩的，每每课间她们总是结伴而出欢呼雀跃；另一类更像假小子一样，喜欢和男孩子混在一起，做一些酷酷的事情，甚至偶尔还会爆一爆粗口——不过她们都很注意不让这样的事情发生，因为虽然那看起来有点酷，可是并不是什么有礼貌和聪明的表现。</p>

<p>赛伦斯哪一类都不属于，或者说她自成一类！课间她不急着和伙伴雀跃而出，也不会帅帅的和男孩子走在一起。很多时候她总是安静地注视着，有时她的注意力集中在男孩们、女孩们那里，也有时她会对着天空和大地发呆，直到被上课的铃声打断。期初同学们会觉得赛伦斯一有点怪怪的，后来就没有人这么想了。这主要有两个原因，一个大概是大家慢慢习惯也就是见怪不怪了，另一个原因来自老师牧明，针对赛伦斯的安静他没有显现出一点担忧和不安来，相反他还常常直呼“安静的赛伦斯同学”——若真的有问题没有哪个老师敢这么直言不讳吧！因此，最后大家都觉得普普通通，事实上也真的就是普普通通。</p>

<p>记得那时初中快要结束的时候，牧明老师在课堂上让大家畅所欲言自己的理想。那个年龄的人当然不会放过如此适合表现的机会，他们极力发挥自己的想象把未来的自己定位的星光灿烂。男孩子们大概就是科学家、体育健将（当然是指篮球、足球那些帅帅的项目），还有计算机的工程师啦、极客啦之类；女孩子则更加时尚，她们的梦想包括T台上的名模、写字楼里优雅的知识女性、知名的歌手演员什么的。轮到赛伦斯的时候，班级里突然安静了下来，大家都想听听这个安静的姑娘是否有不一样的理想。</p>

<p>“我想也许未来的自己会开一家文具店吧，卖漂亮的白纸和各式各样的文具。”赛伦斯安静而又自信的说道，“如果允许，它可能门前会绽放一些小花，每天还会有阳光下走动的人们”。正在同学们为这么一个平庸的想法大眼瞪小眼时，牧明老师评价道“嗯，很不错的一个想法，祝我们安静的赛伦斯同学梦想成真哦！”。</p>

<p>年轻的时光总是飞快，再后来就已经是很多年后的同学聚会了。和歌声里唱的一样“他们已经飞走，散落在天涯”，在告别了学生时代以后，每个人或者为了梦想、或者为了生活早已奔赴海角天涯。这次难得有机会重回故地、重逢故人，大家特意把聚会的地点选在了初中时的小镇上，还尽力邀请了包括牧明老师在内的各位师长——毕竟这样的聚会太难得。</p>

<p>安静的赛伦斯在完成学业后就真的回到小镇开了一家文具店，因此由于地理优势这次她免不了多为同学聚会分担一些。最令人惊奇的是每一个参加聚会的远方同学都接到了赛伦斯的邀请电话，优雅的声音、恰到好处的措辞几乎让人无法拒绝！很多人甚至都有一点点急切想在聚会上看看这位姑娘怎么会有如此改变。</p>

<p>聚会当天又发生了一件惊喜的事情，在酒店的大堂里恰到好处的布置了一些画架，那些画的主题正是当年的各位。每一幅画都朴素而传神，人物的举止神采与那个年龄出奇的贴近，仿佛有了灵魂，活生生的在那里诉说，甚至就连那些草木画都让人迫切的想说出“哦，这就是我们当年校园哪里哪里的那株雏菊花啊！”。</p>

<p>一个消息在惊叹的氛围里慢慢扩散——这些花出自“安静的赛伦斯同学”之手。大家都想听听赛伦斯是如何做到的，这时那个熟悉的安静有自信的声音响起，大堂里出奇的安静就如当年的课堂：“我一直有个梦想，用画笔记录每一寸时光。然而那是的我并不懂绘画，而且每一次这个想法冒出来我的心就激动的砰砰乱跳，根本不可能画好。”赛伦斯淡淡地说，“后来我把自己的苦恼向牧明老师诉说，希望得到一些帮助”。</p>

<blockquote><p>“你的心里养了一只小鸟呢！”牧明老师说。</p>

<p>“啊？可是我怎么不觉得？”</p>

<p>“一直梦想的小鸟啊，不然怎么一提到梦想就砰砰的跳呢！”牧明老师说道，“不过是一只小小的梦想鸟，要你用心呵护”。</p>

<p>“于是，我就决定安静的守护这只梦想啊”赛伦斯把话题拉回到当下，“它还太脆弱，我怕公布出去就破灭了，所以就一直安静的关注着身边发生的事情，希望记下了每个细节。”</p>

<p>“再后来，我觉得在安静和绘画了找到了归属，就更加享受安静的注视生活。在安静里找到了充实和安全，不过现在我想自己的梦想长大了，它可以自己试着飞翔了，我也和它找到了合适的契合点。所以把它和我自己一起展现出来。大概就是如此吧”赛伦斯淡淡一笑，那画面自信而幸福。</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>今天的故事发生在一片古老的土地上，那里地处北国，从来就不缺乏强壮彪悍的民族。光是听听他们的名字：鲜卑、契丹什么的就让人联想到曾经驰骋天涯的壮景，而今天它的名字叫做赤峰。</p>

<p>这是一座座落在黄土地上的城市，位置刚好在我们生活的地球上半个球体的中间偏上。草原和凛风是这里鲜明的标志，它的个性四季分明，乍暖还寒的春季、炎热酷暑的夏季、温润的秋季还有寒风凛冽的冬季，就像是被人为分割的一样毫无交集、年复一年的轮回。</p>

<p>每年有限的雨水成就了这里辽阔的大草原，这里的人们也像这一方水土一样并不复杂，特别是在遥远的古代。他们都是勇猛彪悍的游牧民族，以放牧和打猎为生，因此少不了出色的猎人。今天我们故事的主人公便是一位出色猎手——刚之。刚之从小就热爱打猎，他的足迹遍布这片土地的每个角落，捕获的猎物更是从天空中的飞鸟、陆地上的走兽、水里的游鱼应有尽有。因此刚之的名声早早地就超过了村里的其他人，还超越了相邻村子的猎人和相邻村子的相邻村子的猎人。</p>

<p>世间种种总是相伴而生，最强壮的猎人也总是与最强壮的猎物相伴。今天的另一位主人公是一只野兔——棕大力。虽然我们这位朋友并不高大，但是它有着一颗强大的心。和刚之一样棕大力很小的时候就成为了野兔中的佼佼者，一双有力的后腿总能让它任何地方都疾驰如风。他曾无数次的躲过猎人的箭矢、破解了无数的圈套和陷阱——甚至在猎人圈里它有一个绰号叫做“不可征服的兔子”！</p>

<p>然而我们的不可征服的兔子最近正在练习另一项技能，那正是让它耿耿于怀的——当凛冬降临，白雪覆盖了大地，昔日的河流凝结成冰，棕色的皮毛在白茫茫的天地里不再是很好的保护，而且更要命的是那滑溜溜的冰面，就连棕大力也无法飞奔疾驰。</p>

<p>不知是从哪一年的冬季开始，棕大力开始频繁的出现在凝结的河面上，它一心一意要征服冰面！不知多少个夜晚，棕大力独自来到冰面上练习奔跑，它有力的后腿在冰面上用力蹬踢，尖尖的指甲划过冰面发出刺耳的嘶鸣，但是即便如此它仍然跑得东倒西歪，不断在冰面上打滑摔跤。不知跌倒了多少次，冰面上早就留下斑驳的刮痕，棕大力那油润的皮毛上也粘了大大小小的冰块。可惜取得的进展并不大，面对冰面棕大力仍然显得无计可施，不过一颗坚韧的心会选择默默坚持。</p>

<p>与此同时，棕大力也成为另一个人心里耿耿于怀的一件事，那就是刚之——无疑最强的人永远渴望最强的对手！为了找到与棕大力交手的机会，刚之每年的冬季也会频频出现在结冰的河面上，在寒冷的夜里埋伏下来，希望有机会能和棕大力交手。</p>

<p>不知道那是棕大力开始练习的第几个年头，也许是幸运也许是不幸，一个清晨天才蒙蒙发亮，埋伏了一夜的刚之发现了来到冰面练习奔跑的棕大力。他冷静的拉弓搭箭“嗖”的一声，箭矢直奔棕大力而去。棕大力毕竟是棕大力，只是听到箭矢离开铁弓的声音就足以判断出来向，它本能的身子一歪，箭矢贴着棕色的毛发划过。仿佛是发令信号，刚之和棕大力开始了疯狂地角逐。由于都没有充分准备，在冰面上两位对手频频摔倒又爬起，刚之不断尝试逼迫棕大力跑进自己预先设好的圈套，而棕大力总能一次又一次的识破对手、化险为夷。</p>

<p>这场角逐从清晨进行到晌午，两个对手不知道在长长的河面上奔跑了多远，棕大力无数次地尝试离开河面都被刚之投过来的石块逼了回去；而刚之这个冬季部署的天罗地网也被棕大力一一破解——现在再没有什么圈套，它们都被远远的抛在了身后。</p>

<p>原本两条腿是不可能跑过四条腿的，可是在冰面是上这个定理不再成立。因为打滑带来的不确定性，两者谁都不占优势，这时因为直立行走解放出来的双手却成了唯一可能的优势。刚之充分利用了这一优势不断投掷石块，本来躲开几块石头对棕大力来说也不再话下，只是这半天来的奔袭体力严重下降，躲闪变得越来越吃力。</p>

<p>终于这一丁点的优势成为了压倒骆驼的最后一根稻草。一块飞石重重地击中了棕大力的腹部，它再也支撑不住前脚扑倒在了冰面上。就是这倒下的一瞬间，在惯性的作用下棕大力向前飞快地滑出几十哦不一定是几百米的距离，这种速度是棕大力的平时的土地上从未体验过的——一瞬间天地飞快地穿梭，所有的草木都被远远的退向身后。</p>

<p>石头的重击是致命的，在停下来以后棕大力没有能力继续奔跑，它只能原地等死。这时候刚之也气喘吁吁地赶到了，从那一双大大的棕色眼睛里刚之体会不到一丝恐惧和绝望，相反那里满是兴奋和满足。事实上此时的棕大力也确实如此，虽然面临死亡，但是它已经再也没有遗憾——在有生之年它征服了所有的地形，在那里它奔跑如风，只有这一块冰面是它曾经不能征服的。现在它释然了！它终于找到了征服冰面的办法，那就是滑行！就像流星划过深邃的夜空一样，闪亮而又迅疾！</p>

<p>刚之并不急于给棕大力致命一击，他安静地陪在棕大力的身边，那情景就像陪伴一位多年的老友——在他生命里最后时刻。他把这些年作为猎人的故事一一讲给棕大力听，这位老友似乎也心领神会，在自己最后的时光里陪伴刚之回忆过去的点滴。</p>

<p>终于刚之的故事一个不落的讲完了，棕大力安详的闭上了那双深邃的眼睛，刚之抱起这位朋友尚存余温的尸体，缓缓地走向来时的路，两行清泪划过那因阳光和凛风而深红粗糙的面颊……</p>

<p>从那一天起，刚之再也没有打猎。对手不在了，角逐便也不再！</p>
